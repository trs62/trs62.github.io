Ghibli Park is very near Nagakute Campus (the closest station is the
same as Nagakute Campus). Everyone can enter to the park, but needs
tickets for some special areas. Official excursion of the 62nd TRS
meeting is not organized. Tickets, which must be reserved in advance,
are extremely popular and highly competitive. Ticket reservations for
September will begin on July 10th at 14:00 (JST). Info on reservation
can be seen at the web page of the meeting.
